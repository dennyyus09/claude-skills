Use this skill whenever the user wants to define product strategy, evaluate market positioning, identify target segments, build a competitive differentiation table, or answer questions like 'who should we build for', 'how do we differentiate', 'where do we play', or 'what's our product strategy'. Also trigger when user shares a positioning map, segmentation matrix, or competitive comparison and wants feedback. This skill should run whenever any strategic planning artifact is involved, even if the user doesn't explicitly say 'product strategy'."

# Product Strategy Skill

A structured three-phase framework for building or evaluating product strategy. Developed from the PM practice of Denny Yusuf, referencing Michael Porter's segmentation approach and Shreyas Doshi's product thinking.

**Core sequence:** Positioning → Segmentation → Differentiation

Positioning is a vision tool (where we aspire to be). Segmentation is a strategy tool (who we're building for). Differentiation is an execution tool (how we win with that segment). This order is non-negotiable: vision sets direction, strategy narrows the target, execution proves the claim.

---

## Phase 1 — Positioning (Vision)

### Goal
Map the competitive landscape and find an open, defensible position. Positioning is aspirational at this stage — it does not need to be fully proven yet.

### Steps

**1. Competitor landscape**

Group competitors into archetypes (typically 2–4 groups). Common archetypes:
- Market leaders (dominant generalist players)
- Category specialists (niche but strong in one area)
- Regional/vertical players (strong in a geography or industry)
- Direct mission competitors (same audience, different model)

For each group, identify: what they claim, who they serve, where they are strong.

**2. Positioning map**

Build a 2x2 map. Axes must be derived from how users actually decide, not from where the product already excels. Test: would a user evaluate options along this dimension? If axes were chosen to isolate the product in a favorable quadrant, flag as vanity positioning.

Plot all competitor groups. A clean empty quadrant with no rivals is suspicious — either the axes are reverse-engineered, or key competitors are missing.

**3. Positioning statement**

> "For [who], [product] aims to be the only [category] that [distinctive promise]."

Flag if:
- The promise is a feature, not a meaningful outcome
- The promise is something most competitors already deliver
- The "who" is too broad to be actionable

---

## Phase 2 — Segmentation (Strategy)

### Goal
Identify the highest-priority winnable segment using a Porter-style needs-based matrix. A good segmentation is worth more than any individual feature decision.

### Steps

**1. Choose segmentation dimensions**

Use needs-based dimensions first. If needs alone are insufficient to create meaningful, distinct segments, move to the next criterion in this priority order:

1. Needs
2. Jobs to be done
3. Category of needs
4. Distribution
5. Adoption motion
6. Decision maker
7. Role
8. Core competency
9. Sophistication
10. Geography

Use the minimum number of dimensions needed. A 2x2 or 3x3 matrix is usually sufficient.

**2. Build the segmentation table**

Rows and columns represent the chosen dimensions. Each cell is either:
- A number (1, 2, 3...) indicating priority — 1 is highest
- An x indicating non-viable or not worth pursuing

Example structure:

| Y: Adoption motion \ X: Needs | Religious-driven | Cause-driven |
|---|---|---|
| RC/DHC givers | **1** | x |
| Routine manual givers | 2 | 4 |
| CC-driven manual givers | 3 | x |

**3. Priority-1 segment narrative**

For the #1 cell, write a short description:
- Who they are (behavioral, not just demographic)
- Their decision criteria when choosing a platform or product
- Their current alternatives (what they'd use if this product didn't exist)
- Why this segment is winnable given the positioning in Phase 1

The segment narrative feeds directly into Phase 3 — the factors in the differentiation table must come from this segment's decision criteria.

---

## Phase 3 — Differentiation (Execution)

### Goal
Build a differentiation table that maps the priority-1 segment's decision criteria against competitor groups, then assigns the product a B/T/D rating for each factor.

### Steps

**1. Define factors**

Factors must come from the priority-1 segment's decision criteria identified in Phase 2 — not from the product's known strengths. Reverse-engineering factors from existing advantages produces a vanity differentiation table.

Typical number of factors: 5–8. More than 10 becomes unmanageable.

**2. Score competitors**

Use competitor groups from Phase 1 (no re-mapping needed). Score each group per factor on a 1–3 scale:
- 1 = weak or absent
- 2 = adequate
- 3 = strong

**3. Assign B/T/D for the product**

For each factor, assign one of:
- **B** (Below threshold) — product does not meet the minimum bar this segment expects. Action: fix or reconsider segment fit.
- **T** (Threshold) — product meets the bar but does not stand out. Action: maintain, don't over-invest.
- **D** (Differentiation) — product is genuinely ahead in a way that matters to this segment. Action: protect, deepen, amplify.

**4. Build the table**

| Factor | [Group 1] | [Group 2] | [Group 3] | [Product] |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Factor A | 1–3 | 1–3 | 1–3 | B/T/D |
| Factor B | 1–3 | 1–3 | 1–3 | B/T/D |

**5. Stress-test D claims**

For each D, ask: is this a structural moat or a temporary head start?
- Structural moats: data advantages, network effects, regulatory position, deep segment trust built over time
- Temporary head starts: features that competitors can copy in 6–12 months

Flag temporary head starts — they are not real differentiation without a plan to widen the gap.

**6. Strategy narrative**

Write 2–3 sentences summarizing:
- Where the Ds land (the actual strategic bets)
- What Bs are blockers that need resolving before the strategy is viable
- Roadmap implication: Bs on key factors = fix first; Ts = maintain; Ds = build depth

---

## Guard Rails

Apply these consistently across all three phases:

- **No vanity positioning.** Axes and factors must reflect user decision criteria, not product strengths.
- **No cherry-picked competitors.** Always include the strongest archetype, even if unflattering.
- **No disconnected phases.** Competitor groups from Phase 1 feed Phase 3. Segment criteria from Phase 2 feed Phase 3 factors. If the phases are internally inconsistent, flag it before proceeding.
- **D without durability is misleading.** A D that competitors can replicate in a year is a roadmap item, not a strategic position.
- **Segment first, differentiate second.** A D on a factor the priority-1 segment doesn't care about is meaningless.

---

## Output Format

Deliver each phase sequentially. Do not combine phases into a single artifact — they answer different questions and may have different audiences.

After all three phases, offer a one-paragraph synthesis: how the positioning vision, the target segment, and the differentiation table connect into a coherent strategy.
